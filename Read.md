# Responsive Navigation Bar

A fully responsive navigation bar built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates how to create a navigation menu that adapts to different screen sizes, providing an optimal user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Adjusts the layout based on screen size using CSS media queries.
- **Burger Menu**: Converts the navigation links into a compact "burger" menu on smaller screens, enhancing usability on mobile devices.
- **Smooth Animations**: Includes subtle animations for a polished user experience, such as link fade-ins and burger menu transitions.

## Demo
